# Server Stats

The metrics collection scripts are designed **exclusively for Linux-based operating systems**.

The service relies on commands and virtual filesystems (`/proc`) that are standard on most modern Linux distributions (like Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch, etc.). It is **not** compatible with other operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or other UNIX variants like FreeBSD without significant modification, as they use different commands and system interfaces for metric collection.

## Commands

For the service to collect all available metrics, the authenticated user on the remote server must have permission to execute the following commands. These are standard, non-privileged utilities found on most Linux systems.

| Metric Category | Command(s)                                                                                    | Purpose                                                                                                   |
