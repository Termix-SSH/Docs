## Capabilities

What the plugin's code is allowed to do. Termix shows this list before you install it. See [capabilities](/develop/reference/capabilities) for all of them.

| Capability | Risk | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `auth:provide` | High | Handle sign in. It can add a login method, a second factor or an SSH sign-in type. |
| `network:serve` | Medium | Accept connections. It opens a port on the Termix server. |
| `db:own` | Low | Store its own data. Kept in its own tables, separate from other plugins. |
| `secrets:own` | Low | Store its own secrets. Encrypted by Termix. The plugin never holds the key. |
| `ui:surface` | Low | Add its own screens. Tabs, panels and settings you can hide later. |
