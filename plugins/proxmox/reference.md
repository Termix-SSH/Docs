## Capabilities

What the plugin's code is allowed to do. Termix shows this list before you install it. See [capabilities](/develop/reference/capabilities) for all of them.

| Capability | Risk | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `credentials:read` | Critical | See your passwords and keys. It can read the stored secret for any host you can reach. |
| `ssh:connect` | High | Run commands on your servers. Any command, on hosts you connect it to, with your access. |
| `users:impersonate` | High | Act as other users. Runs background work with another user's access, such as scheduled jobs. Every use is written to the audit log. |
| `hosts:write` | Medium | Create and change hosts. It can add hosts and edit the ones you already have. |
| `credentials:use` | Medium | Connect to your servers. It cannot see your passwords or keys. |
| `network:serve` | Medium | Accept connections. It opens a port on the Termix server. |
| `hosts:read` | Low | See your host list. Names and addresses for hosts you can already see. |
| `db:own` | Low | Store its own data. Kept in its own tables, separate from other plugins. |
| `ui:surface` | Low | Add its own screens. Tabs, panels and settings you can hide later. |
